**Forsaken** is my first attempt at making a decent game with pygame/python. It was originally intended to be my final project for my CT12 course. I have created this seperate branch in order to still work on it and have a place to host my code. If you're here to mark my code, please refer to the [main branch](https://github.com/boopdev/forsaken/tree/main), as this one wil have code which has been commited past the due date, and I don't want to be marked down for that.

Issues can be found [here](https://github.com/boopdev/forsaken/issues) along with features that are intended to be implemented into the game. If you have a suggestion for a feature, create an issue, and among review I will consider whether or not I wish to put it into my game. This game is __mine__ so I plan to put what I want into it.

This project is in no way supposed to be a *"good game"* and is more meant as a learning experience. So please do not make fun of the terrible code, as I know it could very much be improved. Hopefully my game development skills can improve :)
